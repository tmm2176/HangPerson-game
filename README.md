# HangPerson-game
# @author: Taylor McPherson, Summer 2018
# An intersectional-feminist inspired hangman game

First ever personal CS project done outside of coursework. 

Goal: learn Python and apply new knowledge in a fun and socially-inspired way.

Notes for improvement: If revisited, would love to add more to UI interaction,
and clean up code with more knowledge of language.
